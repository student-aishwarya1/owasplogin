OWASP Compliance
To make sure the login form is compliant with OWASP security guidelines:

Password Handling: Ensure that passwords are handled securely on the server side. Use strong hashing algorithms like bcrypt or Argon2.
Input Validation: On the client side, basic input validation is included, but ensure server-side validation as well.
HTTPS: Always use HTTPS to encrypt data transmitted between the client and server.
This setup provides a responsive design and basic functionality. For real-world applications, implement server-side logic and more comprehensive security measures
